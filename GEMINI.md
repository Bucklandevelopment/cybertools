# Project: SCANet - WiFi Security Analysis Network Tool

## Overview

SCANet is a Python-based command-line tool designed for the analysis of wireless network security. It processes CSV files generated by `airodump-ng`, a popular wireless packet capture tool. The primary function of SCANet is to parse this data, store it in a structured SQLite database, and generate insightful reports in both HTML and PDF formats, complete with data visualizations.

The tool is intended for security professionals, network administrators, and researchers to audit and analyze WiFi network configurations and activity.

## Core Functionality

1.  **Parsing**: The tool ingests `airodump-ng` CSV output, which contains two main sections: a list of detected Access Points (APs) and a list of connected Stations (clients). A custom parser separates and cleans this data, loading it into pandas DataFrames.

2.  **Database Storage**: The parsed data is stored in an SQLite database. The schema is normalized, with separate tables for Access Points (`ap`), Stations (`sta`), and probed networks (`probes`). This allows for efficient data management and complex querying.

3.  **Data Visualization**: SCANet generates several key visualizations to help users understand the network environment at a glance:
    *   A bar chart showing the distribution of Access Points across different WiFi channels.
    *   A pie chart illustrating the prevalence of different network encryption standards (e.g., WPA2, WPA, OPN).
    *   A horizontal bar chart ranking the most active networks by the number of connected clients.
    *   A network topology graph that visualizes the relationships between Access Points and the Stations connected to them.

4.  **Report Generation**: The final output is a comprehensive report, available in two formats:
    *   **HTML**: An interactive and modern-looking report created using a Jinja2 template. It embeds the generated charts as base64-encoded images, making it a self-contained file.
    *   **PDF**: A printable version of the report, generated by converting the HTML file using `pdfkit`.

5.  **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: The tool is operated via a user-friendly CLI built with the `click` library. It provides two main commands:
    *   `analyze`: The primary command that runs the full pipelineâ€”parsing the CSV, populating the database, and generating reports.
    *   `query`: An interface to run custom SQL queries directly against the generated database for more advanced, specific analysis.

## Technical Stack

*   **CLI Framework**: `click`
*   **Data Manipulation**: `pandas`
*   **Database**: `sqlite3` (via Python's standard library)
*   **Visualization**: `matplotlib` and `networkx`
*   **Report Templating**: `jinja2`
*   **PDF Conversion**: `pdfkit` (a wrapper for `wkhtmltopdf`)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a `src/scanet` package with a clear separation of concerns:

*   `cli.py`: Handles all command-line logic and user interaction.
*   `parser.py`: Contains the logic for reading and parsing the input CSV file.
*   `database.py`: Manages all database interactions, including table creation, data insertion, and querying for stats.
*   `visualizer.py`: Responsible for creating all charts and graphs.
*   `reporter.py`: Contains the logic for generating the final HTML and PDF reports.

This modular structure makes the codebase easy to maintain and extend.
