# Analysis Modules & Tools

This directory is intended to hold information and scripts related to the analysis of captured network traffic. The tools themselves (`tshark`, `wireshark`, etc.) are installed system-wide, but this space can be used for helper scripts or notes.

## Using TShark for Traffic Analysis

`tshark` is the command-line interface for Wireshark and is an extremely powerful tool for analyzing `.pcap` files generated by tools like `airodump-ng` or our Evil Twin script.

### Basic Usage

**Live Capture:**
You can capture traffic live from an interface. This is very useful for monitoring the traffic from clients connected to your Evil Twin AP.

```bash
# Capture traffic from wlan1 and print a summary to the console
sudo tshark -i wlan1

# Capture traffic and save it to a file for later analysis
sudo tshark -i wlan1 -w capture.pcap
```

**Reading from a File:**
You can analyze a capture file you've already created.

```bash
# Read and display a summary of a capture file
tshark -r capture.pcap
```

### Filtering Traffic

The real power of `tshark` comes from its display filters (`-Y` option).

**Find DNS Queries:**
See what websites clients are trying to access.
```bash
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "dns.qry.name" -T fields -e dns.qry.name
```

**Find HTTP GET/POST Requests:**
In unencrypted (HTTP) traffic, you can see the exact pages being visited.
```bash
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "http.request"
```

**Filter by IP Address:**
Isolate all traffic going to or from a specific client.
```bash
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "ip.addr == 192.168.42.123"
```

**Extract Usernames/Passwords from Unencrypted Logins:**
Many protocols send login information in plain text. You can often find credentials this way.
```bash
# Example for FTP
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "ftp.request.command == USER or ftp.request.command == PASS"

# Example for HTTP Basic Auth (often base64 encoded)
tshark -r capture.pcap -Y "http.authorization"
```

This is just the tip of the iceberg. `tshark` is a deep and powerful tool, and learning to use it effectively is a critical skill for network analysis.
